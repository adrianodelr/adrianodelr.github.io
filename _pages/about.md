I am a recent graduate with a Master's in Robotics and Control from Centrale Nantes. After graduating, I started an internship at Thales, where I am currently developing a prototype system for state estimation of military training equipement. Prior to that, I worked at the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence, where I developed and implemented control algorithms for robotic applications. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Bionics from Bremen City University of Applied Sciences, and also have background in industral management.
